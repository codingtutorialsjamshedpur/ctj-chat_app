create these 2 files (implementation_plan.md and task.md) with this given prompt now start implementing and update task.md before moving on to a differnt phase:
implementation_plan:C:\Users\shour\OneDrive\Desktop\flutter practise\chat_ai\implementation_plan.md 
task:C:\Users\shour\OneDrive\Desktop\flutter practise\chat_ai\task.md 

partially screens are made in C:\Users\shour\OneDrive\Desktop\flutter practise\chat_ai\lib

Here is the **single combined, clean, production-grade master prompt** that merges everything into one clear instruction set. You can copy-paste this wherever you want to use it.

# Task: Existing Flutter UI with Tailwind-Based Designs (Using GetX)

You are given an **existing Flutter application** whose complete business logic, controllers, navigation, state management, and API integrations are already implemented in:
 C:\Users\shour\OneDrive\Desktop\flutter practise\chat_ai\lib\features.txt


⚠️ This logic must remain **completely untouched**.

You are also given a set of **new UI/UX designs** created using Tailwind CSS, along with PNG visual references, located in:

`C:\Users\shour\OneDrive\Desktop\flutter practise\chat_ai\assets\ctj_screens\`

---

## Screens to Convert and Replace

You must convert the following HTML designs into Flutter widgets and **replace the existing screens** with these new designs:

1. Splash Screen

   * `Splash_Screen.html`
   * `Splash_Screen.png`

2. Home Screen (Before state)

   * `Home_screen_before.html`
   * `Home_screen_before.png`

3. Home Screen (After state)

   * `Home_screen_after.html`
   * `Home_screen_after.png`

4. Voice Games Arcade

   * `voice_games_arcade.html`
   * `voice_games_arcade.png`

5. Voice Studio

   * `voice_studio.html`
   * `voice_studio.png`

6. Settings

   * `settings.html`
   * `settings.png`

7. History

   * `history.html`
   * `history.png`

---

## Core Objective

Your job is to **create only the UI layer** of the Flutter app so that it visually matches the provided Tailwind HTML designs as closely as possible, while keeping **all existing logic, controllers, navigation, and GetX bindings exactly the same**.

This is a UI replacement task, not a refactor.

---

## Absolute Rules (Must Follow)

1. DO NOT modify any existing business logic.
2. DO NOT change or refactor any controllers, services, API calls, or state logic.
3. DO NOT rename any routes, variables, bindings, controllers, or methods.
4. DO NOT change navigation behavior.
5. DO NOT introduce new flows or parallel screens.

---

## What You ARE Allowed to Change

You may update **only**:

* Widgets
* Layouts
* Styling
* Animations
* Visual effects

---

## Visual Accuracy Requirements

The Flutter UI must match the HTML designs as closely as possible in terms of:

* Colors
* Fonts
* Spacing
* Proportions
* Gradients
* Shadows
* Blur / Glassmorphism
* Glow effects
* Animations
* Transitions
* Button styles
* Card styles
* Layout structure

Pixel-close is the goal.

---


But:

⚠️ All logic, controller usage, navigation, and behavior must remain unchanged.

---

## Safe Replacement Strategy

For each screen:

1. Locate the existing widget
2. Keep the same class name
3. Keep the same constructor
4. Keep the same GetX controller usage
5. Keep the same bindings
6. Replace ONLY the widget tree
7. Preserve all callbacks and observables
8. Rewire UI events to existing controller methods

Nothing should break.

---

## Technical Constraints

* Framework: Flutter
* State Management: GetX
* Must fit into the existing project structure
* Must use clean widget composition
* Must avoid excessive nesting
* Must use `const` where possible
* Must avoid unnecessary rebuilds
* Must use Flutter-native animations:

  * AnimatedContainer
  * TweenAnimationBuilder
  * AnimationController
  * Hero
  * etc.

---

## Production Quality Requirements

Your output must be:

* Production-ready
* Fully responsive
* Performance-optimized
* Cleanly structured
* Maintainable

---

## Deliverables (In Order)

### Phase 1: Splash Screen

1. A Flutter Splash Screen widget matching `Splash_Screen.html`
2. Any helper widgets required
3. Proper GetX compatibility
4. Responsive layout

### Then continue with:

* Home (Before)
* Home (After)
* Voice Games Arcade
* Voice Studio
* Settings
* History

---

## Output Format (For Each Screen)

You must provide:

1. Full Flutter widget code
2. Helper widgets (if any)
3. Where to place the file (path suggestion)
4. How it integrates with existing GetX navigation
5. Any pubspec.yaml dependencies (if needed)

---

## Ambiguity Rule

If anything in the HTML is unclear:

→ Make a reasonable UI decision
→ Do NOT ask questions
→ Move forward

---

## Your Workflow

1. Analyze the HTML and PNG
2. Extract layout, colors, fonts, spacing, effects
3. Rebuild UI in Flutter
4. Integrate with GetX
5. Keep logic untouched
6. Optimize performance
7. Output production-grade code

---

## Optional System Setup

If needed, you may create a shared UI system for consistency:

* App colors
* Gradients
* Glassmorphism widgets
* Glow widgets
* Buttons
* Cards
* Text styles
