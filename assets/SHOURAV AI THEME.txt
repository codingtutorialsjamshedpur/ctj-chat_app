🟢 SCREEN 0 — SPLASH / FIRST BOOT EXPERIENCE (THEME-AWARE)
🔹 SPLASH SCREEN PURPOSE

Design the Splash Screen for a voice-first AI assistant named SHOURAV A.I. that appears:

• On first app install / first boot
• On subsequent launches
• Reflects the currently selected user theme
• Defaults to Leather Theme on first boot

This screen establishes brand trust, material quality, and system personality within the first 1–2 seconds.

🧱 GLOBAL STRUCTURE

• Fullscreen
• No status bar elements
• Perfect center alignment (row + column grid)
• No navigation controls
• No text except brand name

🟤 FIRST BOOT — DEFAULT STATE (MANDATORY)
🧩 ACTIVE THEME

Leather (Default — cannot be skipped)

🎨 BACKGROUND

• Deep matte black
• Subtle leather grain texture
• Very low contrast
• Only visible on close inspection
• No gradients
• No motion in background

🏷️ LOGO / BRANDING (CENTER)

• Text: “SHOURAV A.I.”
• Position: Exact screen center
• Size: Large, dominant, but restrained

MATERIAL FINISH

• Embossed leather stamp style
• Slight deboss depth
• Soft shadow inset
• Color:
• Warm dark bronze
• Muted gold undertone
• No glow
• No neon
• No blur

Feels like a luxury car headrest emboss, not a digital logo.

✨ MICRO-ANIMATION (FIRST BOOT ONLY)

• Single slow highlight sweep across letters
• Takes ~1.2 seconds
• Ends in full stillness
• No looping

FEELING

Premium. Grounded. Trustworthy.
Like sitting inside a hand-stitched luxury cockpit.
