purple color with nothing phone theme: design style

Screen 0: Splash Screen

Create a modern, immersive splash screen for a voice AI assistant app using Flutter. The UI should feature a dark theme with a dynamic, animated gradient background that rotates slowly through rainbow colors (purples, blues, greens, oranges) for a cosmic, energetic feel. At the center, place a scalable, pulsing icon (a stylized microphone or AI orb) that enters with an elastic scale animation from 0 to 1 over 1.2 seconds, with a glow effect pulsing every 1.5 seconds. Below the icon, animate in the app title "CTJ AI" sliding up from 50 pixels below with ease-out cubic curve over 0.8 seconds, using a bold, futuristic font like Google Fonts' Orbitron in white with a subtle shadow. Include particle effects around the icon, with small dots animating in a repeating cycle over 3 seconds. No interactive elements; the screen auto-transitions after 6 seconds with a fade-in to the main page. Ensure the design is full-screen, responsive for mobile, and optimized for performance by reducing blur intensities. Incorporate a subtle audio player trigger for a splash sound effect.

Prompt for 1Home_screen_before.jpeg:
Design a modern, upgraded UI/UX for the home screen of a voice assistant app called CTJ AI, before any user interaction begins. This screen should not use a bottom sheet layout; instead, it should be a full-screen interface. The background is a dark, gradient from purple to green with blurred, animated blob effects for a dynamic, immersive feel. At the top, show a header with the user's name "Shourav" in light gray, followed by icons for gaming (controller), voice waves, undo, settings gear, and trash. Below that, display current weather and AQI like "17.5°C ☁️ AQI: 164" in cyan. There's a small "hello" bubble in blue at the top right. Centrally, feature a large happy speaking face emoji (cyan eyes and mouth) with a "STOP" red button below it. Under the button, display a block of Hindi text in white on a dark purple overlay: "hain. Bhasha aur sangeet ki baat karein toh hamri apni Bhojpuri bhasha hai Bihar ki jaan. Birha, Chaita, Kajariwa, jaise lok geet hain jo dil ko chhu jaate hain. Khana-peena kaise bhool sakte hain? Litti Chokha toh hai hi, uske saath Sattu ka sharbat, Dal Pitha, Anarsa, Thekua... waah, swad aisa ki bhookh badh jaaye. Aanko Bihar ke baare mein aur kya?" At the bottom, a green input bar with "Ask anything..." text and a microphone icon in a cyan circle. Ensure the design is minimalistic, with rounded corners, glassmorphism effects on overlays, and subtle animations for the blobs and face. Incorporate elements from the app's code, such as wake lock, vibration feedback, and audio players for immersive audio. Use a dark theme with cyan accents for a futuristic voice AI feel.

Prompt for 2Home_screen_after.jpeg:
Design an enhanced UI/UX for the home screen of the CTJ AI voice assistant app after user interaction, focusing on a conversation view. This should be a full-screen layout without a bottom sheet. The background features a vibrant, animated gradient from green to purple with liquid blob animations for depth. Top header includes "Shourav" in gray, icons for game controller, voice waves, undo, settings, and trash, plus weather/AQI "22.5°C ☁️ AQI: 157" in cyan. A "hello" bubble in blue at top right. Show conversation bubbles: Assistant in dark purple with Hindi text "Namaste Shourav. Kya haal hai aapke?" and user in teal "Kya Aap Mujhe Kar ka photo Banakar de sakte hain". Then another assistant response in purple: "Shourav, main abhi photo banane ki suvidha nahi de sakta. Main ek text-based assistant hoon. Aap mujhe bata sakte hain ki aapko kaisi photo chahiye. Main uske liye ek detailed description, creative ideas ya phir ek prompt de sakta hoon jise aap kisi image generator tool mein use kar sakte hain. Aap batayiye, aapko kya chahiye?" At the bottom, a cyan input bar with "Ask anything..." and microphone icon. Add subtle animations like fading bubbles, glassmorphism on text overlays, and integrate code elements like TTS for voice output, speech-to-text input, and HTTP calls for AI responses from Gemini or OpenRouter APIs. Emphasize a clean, chat-like interface with rounded bubbles, cyan highlights, and dark mode for better readability and engagement.

Prompt for 3voice_games_arcade.jpeg:
Create an upgraded, interactive UI/UX for the Voice Games Arcade screen in the CTJ AI app, presented as a modal bottom sheet that slides up from the bottom, covering most of the screen with rounded top corners and a drag handle. The background should blend with the app's gradient (purple-green) but dimmed for modal focus. Header text "Voice Games Arcade" in white, subtitle "Play interactive voice games with AI" in gray. Below, a "Difficulty" section with toggle buttons: Easy (gray), Medium (selected in cyan), Hard (gray), rounded and pill-shaped. Then, a grid of game cards: First "20 Questions" with purple question mark icon, description "Think of something and I'll try to guess it in..."; Second "Roast Battle" with orange flame icon, "Friendly roasting exchange - see who has the best..."; Third "Compliment Generator" with pink heart icon; Fourth "Story Time" with green book icon, "Interactive storytelling where...". Each card has glassmorphism overlay, icons in circles, bold titles, and short descriptions. Integrate code features like audio players for game sounds, shared preferences for saving difficulty, and vibration for button feedback. Add animations for card hover/selection, cyan accents on selected items, and ensure voice input integration via speech-to-text for game interactions. Keep it engaging with minimal text and large touch targets.

Prompt for 4voice_studio.jpeg:
Design a polished UI/UX upgrade for the Voice Studio screen in CTJ AI, implemented as a bottom sheet modal that emerges from the bottom with a semi-transparent overlay on the main screen, rounded top edges, and close gesture support. Title "Voice Studio" in white, subtitle "Customize your AI's voice signature" in gray. Below, a voice waveform visualization in cyan bars of varying heights. Then, "Presets" section with buttons: Normal (selected), Bass Boost, Chi (possibly truncated from Chill or similar), rounded pills. Sliders: "Pitch" with cyan slider at 1.0, "Speed" with purple slider at 0.75x. Incorporate app code elements like Flutter TTS for voice customization, shared preferences to save settings, and audio effects via audioplayers. Add real-time preview buttons or icons to test voice changes, subtle animations on sliders (e.g., glow on drag), and cyan/purple accents for controls. Ensure the design is intuitive for voice tweaking, with large sliders and minimal clutter in dark mode.

Prompt for 5history.jpeg:
Develop an improved UI/UX for the Conversation History screen in the CTJ AI app, using a bottom sheet presentation that slides up, with a handle at the top and dismissible by swipe down. Background dimmed gradient matching the app's theme. Title "Conversation History" in white. Below, a scrollable list of messages: "hello" as USER in bold, then ASSISTANT "Namaste Shourav. Kya h..." (truncated), USER "Kya Aap Mujhe Kar ka p...", ASSISTANT (empty or truncated), USER "Shourav, main abhi phot...", ASSISTANT (empty). Each entry labeled as USER or ASSISTANT in gray caps, with message text in white. Include code integrations like Hive for storing history, scroll controller for smooth navigation, and options to clear history via the trash icon in header. Add features like tappable messages to replay via TTS, subtle dividers between entries, and cyan highlights on hover. Keep it simple, list-based, with dark theme and rounded corners for a clean archive view.

Prompt for 6settings.jpeg:
Craft an enhanced UI/UX for the Settings screen in CTJ AI, displayed as a bottom sheet modal rising from the bottom, with rounded top, drag indicator, and overlay on the underlying screen.

Dropdown for "Select AI Model" with options: Gemini 1.5 Flash (Primary, selected), Gemini 1.5 Pro, Xiaomi Mimo V2 Flash (Free), Qwen 2.5 Coder (Free). Slider for "Voice Pitch (Bass)" from Normal to High Pitch, set low with cyan handle and reset icon. Dropdown for "Select Voice" with "Hinglish - Female" selected.

Add animations for toggle/switch (e.g., smooth slide), icons for each section, and cyan accents. Ensure intuitive layout with sections divided by subtle lines, dark mode compatibility, and test buttons for voice previews.
