C:\Users\shour\OneDrive\Desktop\flutter practise\chat_ai\lib\ui these are the new screens C:\Users\shour\OneDrive\Desktop\flutter practise\chat_ai\assets\ctj_screens\screens.txt made now i wanted to confirm that in C:\Users\shour\OneDrive\Desktop\flutter practise\chat_ai\lib\main.dart these screens are replaced with old screens and replaced with these new screens or not?C:\Users\shour\OneDrive\Desktop\flutter practise\chat_ai\lib\running_code.txt consists of old screens and buisness logic .
I have checked lib/main.dart and it still contains the old screens. The new screens are present in lib/ui/screens/ but are currently static mockups and have not been integrated into the main application logic yet.

Would you like me to proceed with replacing the old screens in lib/main.dart with these new designs while preserving your existing business logic?yes
You are an expert Flutter UI/UX engineer with strong experience in converting modern HTML/CSS designs into pixel-perfect Flutter screens.

I have an existing Flutter application whose full source code is in `C:\Users\shour\OneDrive\Desktop\flutter practise\chat_ai\lib\main.dart`. This app already contains complete business logic, navigation logic, state management, and API integrations.

I also have a new UI/UX design for screens in the form of containing in the folder as C:\Users\shour\OneDrive\Desktop\flutter practise\chat_ai\assets\ctj_screens:

C:\Users\shour\OneDrive\Desktop\flutter practise\chat_ai\assets\ctj_screens\Splash_Screen
* `Splash_Screen.html` (Tailwind-based design)
* `Splash_Screen.png` (visual reference)

C:\Users\shour\OneDrive\Desktop\flutter practise\chat_ai\assets\ctj_screens\Home_screen_before
* `Home_screen_before.html` (Tailwind-based design)
* `Home_screen_before.png` (visual reference)

C:\Users\shour\OneDrive\Desktop\flutter practise\chat_ai\assets\ctj_screens\Home_screen_after
* `Home_screen_after.html` (Tailwind-based design)
* `Home_screen_after.png` (visual reference)

C:\Users\shour\OneDrive\Desktop\flutter practise\chat_ai\assets\ctj_screens\voice_games_arcade
* `voice_games_arcade.html` (Tailwind-based design)
* `voice_games_arcade.png` (visual reference)

C:\Users\shour\OneDrive\Desktop\flutter practise\chat_ai\assets\ctj_screens\voice_studio
* `voice_studio.html` (Tailwind-based design)
* `voice_studio.png` (visual reference)

C:\Users\shour\OneDrive\Desktop\flutter practise\chat_ai\assets\ctj_screens\settings
* `settings.html` (Tailwind-based design)
* `settings.png` (visual reference)

C:\Users\shour\OneDrive\Desktop\flutter practise\chat_ai\assets\ctj_screens\history
* `history.html` (Tailwind-based design)
* `history.png` (visual reference)

### Your Task

Convert the UI/UX of `Splash_Screen.html,Home_screen_before.html,Home_screen_after.html,voice_games_arcade.html,voice_studio.html,settings.html,history.html` 
into Flutter (Dart) code using **GetX** state management.

### Strict Rules

1. DO NOT modify any existing business logic.
2. DO NOT change any controllers, services, API calls, or navigation logic unless absolutely required to render the UI.
3. DO NOT rename existing routes, variables, or controllers unless unavoidable.
4. ONLY update the UI layer (widgets, layout, styling, animations, and visual effects).
5. Match the HTML design as closely as possible:

   * Colors
   * Fonts
   * Gradients
   * Shadows
   * Glassmorphism effects
   * Glow effects
   * Animations
   * Spacing and proportions
6. The Flutter output should be production-ready and responsive.
7. Use best practices for Flutter UI performance.

### Technical Requirements

* Framework: Flutter
* State management: GetX
* Must be compatible with the existing project structure.
* Use clean widget composition.
* Avoid unnecessary rebuilds.
* Animations should use Flutter’s native animation tools (AnimatedContainer, Tween, AnimationController, etc).

### Deliverables

1. A Flutter Splash Screen widget that visually matches `Splash_Screen.html`.
2. Any helper widgets needed (if required).
3. Clear instructions on where to place the new files.
4. Mention any pubspec dependencies required (if any).

If something is ambiguous, make a reasonable UI decision instead of asking questions.

Start by analyzing the HTML and PNG carefully, then generate the Flutter code.
