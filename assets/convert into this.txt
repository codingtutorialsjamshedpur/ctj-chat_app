Perfect.
Below is a **SINGLE, COMPLETE, READY-TO-PASTE MASTER PROMPT** that you can directly give to **Claude, Gemini, Google Stitch, or any design-AI**.

This prompt already **bakes in**:

✔ Directional Drag (not swipe)
✔ Anticipatory Animation
✔ Threshold-Based Commit
✔ Spring Physics
✔ Your **REC-centered joystick UI**
✔ **SCREEN 1C = Interactive Voice Games**
✔ Nothing OS + Luxury Automotive discipline
✔ No code, only design + interaction logic

You do **not** need to explain anything to the AI beyond this.

# 🧠 MASTER DESIGN & INTERACTION PROMPT

*(Paste exactly as-is into Claude / Gemini / Stitch)*

---

## 🔰 PROJECT OVERVIEW

Design a **system-level, voice-first AI assistant interface** named **SHOURAV A.I.**, inspired by:

• Android system call UI
• Nothing OS interaction discipline
• Luxury automotive control consoles
• Human–machine joystick metaphors

The interface must feel **OS-level**, **mechanical**, and **intentional**, not app-like.

---

## 🔑 CORE INTERACTION PHILOSOPHY (MANDATORY)

### ❌ DO NOT USE

• Swipe navigation
• Flick gestures
• Instant tap actions for critical flows
• Linear or teleporting animations

### ✅ USE ONLY

1️⃣ **Directional Drag (finger remains in contact)**
2️⃣ **Anticipatory Animation before commit**
3️⃣ **Threshold-Based Commit (distance-driven)**
4️⃣ **Spring Physics for all returns and cancels**

> The UI must preview intent **before** executing actions.

---

## 🎛️ GLOBAL CONTROL MODEL

### CENTER-LOCKED RADIAL DRAG CONTROLLER

• A single **REC (Mic) control** is fixed at the **exact center of the screen**
• Acts as a **mechanical joystick**, not a button
• Accepts **four-directional drag input**
• Moves physically with the user’s finger
• Direction locks after initial movement
• Releasing early always returns to center with **spring physics**

---

## 🧭 GESTURE MAPPING (GLOBAL)

| Direction | Interaction Type            | Commit Threshold | Action                      |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| UP        | Vertical Directional Drag   | 60–70% radius    | Change Persona              |
| DOWN      | Vertical Directional Drag   | 60–70% radius    | Send / Confirm              |
| LEFT      | Horizontal Directional Drag | 60–70% radius    | **Interactive Voice Games** |
| RIGHT     | Horizontal Directional Drag | 60–70% radius    | Settings                    |

• Below threshold → **Preview only**
• Beyond threshold → **Commit + haptic confirmation**
• Release early → **Elastic spring-back**

---

## 🟢 SCREEN 1 — HOME (Voice Control · Rest State)

### LAYOUT

• Pure black background
• Absolute horizontal & vertical symmetry
• REC control placed at **true screen center (row + column aligned)**

---

### 🎙️ REC CONTROL (CORE ELEMENT)

• Large circular metallic control
• Automotive start/stop inspiration
• Chrome or soft gold ring (theme aware)
• Text **“SHOURAV A.I.”** appears **engraved / minted** into the metal
• No glow, no neon

---

### 🌀 IDLE STATE

• No pulsing animation
• Only subtle metallic light sweep
• Calm, confident, waiting state

---

### 🧠 ANTICIPATORY FEEDBACK (CRITICAL)

When user touches and begins dragging the REC control:

• REC moves **1:1 with finger**
• Directional hints fade in progressively
• Action labels appear **before commit**
• Opposing directions fade out
• Resistance increases near commit threshold

> The system must clearly communicate **what will happen next**.

---

## 🟢 SCREEN 1A — DRAG UP (CHANGE PERSONA)

• Upward drag lifts REC slightly
• Upper arc illuminates progressively
• Label fades in: **“CHANGE PERSONA”**
• Commit only after threshold
• Cancel returns with spring physics

---

## 🟢 SCREEN 1B — DRAG DOWN (SEND / CONFIRM)

• Downward drag compresses REC inward
• Chrome ring tightens visually
• Label appears: **“SEND”**
• Threshold crossing locks action
• Early release cancels with elastic return

---

## 🟢 SCREEN 1C — DRAG LEFT (INTERACTIVE VOICE GAMES)

### PURPOSE

Enter **Interactive Voice Games Mode**
(voice-driven challenges, reflex games, puzzles, memory games)

---

### INTERACTION BEHAVIOR

• Horizontal directional drag to the left
• REC follows finger physically
• Left arc illuminates progressively
• Abstract, playful game glyphs fade in
• Label appears gradually:
**“VOICE GAMES”**

• Resistance increases near commit zone
• Commit only after threshold
• Release before threshold → spring-back

---

### POST-COMMIT TRANSITION

• Transition continues leftward momentum
• Interface shifts into **Voice Games Hub**
• REC recenters automatically
• Tone shifts from “assistant” to “playful system”

---

### FEELING

Like sliding a **console selector into Game Mode** —
intentional, previewed, mechanically satisfying.

---

## 🟢 SCREEN 1D — DRAG RIGHT (SETTINGS)

• Rightward drag reveals gear outline
• Mechanical resistance near commit
• Subtle click on commit
• Cancel springs back smoothly

---

## 🟢 SCREEN 2 — GESTURE MODE (PRESS-AND-HOLD)

• Activated by **press-and-hold**, not swipe
• REC locks into joystick state
• Directional arcs animate continuously
• Commit requires distance threshold
• Release always returns to center with spring motion

---

## 🟢 SPEAKING & LISTENING STATES (GLOBAL RULE)

• Directional drag must remain available during speech
• Live speech-to-text appears immediately
• No blocking UI states
• No delayed transitions

---

## 🧠 FINAL SYSTEM RULE

> This interface replaces swipe navigation with a **center-locked directional drag system** using **anticipatory feedback**, **threshold-based intent confirmation**, and **spring-physics motion**, delivering a **system-level human–machine interaction experience**.

---

### ❗ IMPORTANT

• Do NOT simplify gestures
• Do NOT remove resistance or preview states
• Do NOT convert drag into swipe
• The UI must feel **mechanical, deliberate, and OS-level**

---

If you want, next I can:
• Adapt this prompt specifically for **Google Stitch syntax**
• Create a **Claude-optimized variant**
• Convert this into a **UX justification / pitch deck**
• Or translate this into **Flutter gesture architecture**

Just tell me which one.
